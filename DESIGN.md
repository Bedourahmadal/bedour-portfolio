# Sequence — Style Reference
> blueprint paper with violet annotations. A near-white editorial surface where everything is grayscale and one precise violet pulse marks every action worth taking.

**Theme:** light

Sequence reads like an editorial finance publication rendered in product form: a near-white canvas, a humanist sans (TWK Lausanne) carrying almost all interface text, and a light-weight serif (Moderat Serif) used sparingly on large display headlines to inject editorial gravity. Depth comes from hairline borders and thin layered shadows, not heavy panels or colored fills. A single vivid violet (#a565ff) is the only chromatic accent in the system — it functions as a precise annotation, appearing on primary CTAs, active icons, and subtle brand glows, while the rest of the interface stays in cool grays. Soft blue-violet radial washes in hero and section backgrounds create atmospheric depth without committing to color, and the overall density is compact and precise rather than spacious or airy.

## Colors

| Name | Value | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| Violet Pulse | `#a565ff` | Primary CTAs, active icons, brand glow accents — the single chromatic accent in the system; everything else defers to it |
| Indigo Ink | `#5e5cff` | Link text, secondary text emphasis, and accent strokes where violet would be too loud |
| Lavender Wash | `#ebebff` | Soft tinted backgrounds for highlighted callouts and subtle surface differentiation |
| Iris Glow | `#e0c9ff` | Violet supporting accent for decorative details and low-frequency emphasis. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color |
| Ledger Green | `#2e7317` | Green text accent for links, tags, and emphasized short phrases. Use as a supporting accent, not as a status color |
| Paper White | `#ffffff` | Primary canvas, card surfaces, button fills, and elevated surface layer |
| Bone | `#f7f7f7` | Recessed card surfaces and subtle panel backgrounds one step off white |
| Fog | `#f1f1f1` | Disabled surface fills, table row alternates, and recessed UI regions |
| Silver | `#efefef` | Inset borders, button outlines, and shadow-stack fills for elevation |
| Marble | `#fff6df` | Warm cream accent for announcement bars and subtle highlight bands |
| Graphite | `#1d1d20` | Primary heading and body text — near-black with a barely-warm tint |
| Slate | `#42424a` | Secondary headings, emphasized body text, and list accents |
| Iron | `#505050` | Default body text and the most-used text color across the system |
| Steel | `#757575` | Muted helper text, navigation labels, and secondary table text |
| Smoke | `#92939e` | Placeholder text, disabled labels, and tertiary table cells |
| Ash | `#e5e7eb` | Default hairline border — the structural backbone of the entire UI; the most-used color in the system |
| Mist | `#d1d9e4` | Cooler border for inputs, dividers, and sections needing visual separation from Ash |
| Olive Gray | `#808076` | SVG illustration stroke and fill — the default for vector graphics in content |
| Noir | `#000000` | Icon fills and contrast anchors where pure black is required |

## Typography

### TWK Lausanne — Primary UI typeface — all body text, navigation, buttons, labels, and most headings from 8px to 24px. A humanist sans with open apertures that stays legible at 10–12px in dense tables and form chrome.
- **Substitute:** Inter, IBM Plex Sans, or Söhne
- **Weights:** 300, 400, 500, 600, 700

### Navigation Link
**Role:** Top-level nav items and inline text links

Text #505050 weight 500 at 14px, no underline. Active state shifts to #1d1d20 and may carry a 1px #1d1d20 underline. Hover transitions to #1d1d20.

### Display Headline Block

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Violet Pulse (#a565ff) exclusively for the single primary CTA per screen; never for body text, icons in resting state, or large fills
- Set all headings 24px and above in TWK Lausanne weight 300; reserve Moderat Serif for the 40–46px display headline only
- Use Ash (#e5e7eb) 1px as the default border across cards, dividers, inputs, and tiles — this is the structural line of the system
- Apply the pill radius (9999px) to all buttons, nav items, and tags; use 8px for cards and 4px for inputs and small interactive elements
- Anchor every section to a white or near-white surface; let depth come from hairline borders and the layered shadow stack, not colored fills
- Pair Lavender Wash (#ebebff) with Iris Glow (#e0c9ff) when building tinted callouts or highlighted states — never use them as large surface fills
- Keep section gaps at 80px and card padding at 24px; drop to 16px padding only in dense grid cells or product chrome

### Don't
- Don't introduce any new chromatic color — the system is monochrome grays plus exactly one violet accent and one green semantic
- Don't use Moderat Serif below 40px or for anything other than the h1 display headline; it will lose its editorial weight
- Don't apply colored backgrounds to large content regions; atmospheric depth comes from the soft blue-violet radial gradient washes, not solid color
- Don't use heavy drop shadows; the system relies on thin 1px rings and tightly-clamped offset shadows, never blurry elevation blobs
- Don't set body text below 12px; the smallest TWK Lausanne size for any user-facing text is 12px, with 14px as the comfortable default
- Don't use Indigo Ink (#5e5cff) as a button background — it is a link and secondary-text color, not an action fill
- Don't round buttons or tags with 8px; they must be pills (9999px) to maintain the contrast against the 8px card radius

## Elevation

- **Primary CTA button:** `0px 0px 0px 1px rgba(58,58,64,0.1), 0px 1px 3px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0px 1px 2px -1px rgba(0,0,0,0.1) + violet halo via #e0c9ff at ~20% opacity 0 0 8px 2px`
- **Product screenshot cards:** `0px 0px 0px 2px rgb(239,239,239), 0px 22px 9px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.01), 0px 12px 7px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.04), 0px 5px 5px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.06), 0px 1px 3px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.07)`
- **Secondary/outlined button:** `0px 0px 0px 1px rgba(29,29,32,0.08)`
- **Subtle elevation ring:** `0px 0px 0px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)`

## Surfaces

- **Page Canvas** (`#ffffff`) — Base page background, hero and section backgrounds
- **Recessed Surface** (`#f7f7f7`) — Card and panel surfaces sitting one step below the canvas
- **Tinted Surface** (`#ebebff`) — Lavender-tinted highlight regions for special content blocks
- **Warm Accent** (`#fff6df`) — Cream announcement bar and warm highlight bands

## Imagery

Imagery is restrained and product-centric: no lifestyle photography, no stock imagery, no decorative illustrations. The visual content is almost entirely UI mockups — floating product screenshot cards showing contract interfaces, billing forms, and invoice tables rendered in the same TWK Lausanne / grayscale palette as the rest of the site. Integration logos appear as small monochrome wordmarks inside bordered tiles. A subtle concentric-circle diagram appears once in the product suite section as a structural diagram in #e5e7eb strokes. The hero uses a soft blue-violet radial gradient wash (radial-gradient with rgba(186,217,249,0.8) and rgba(234,234,255,0.8)) as background atmosphere rather than any photographic content. Icons are 1.5–2px stroke, line-style, monochrome in #1d1d20 or #505050 — the only colored icon usage is the Violet Pulse active state.

## Layout

Max-width 1200px centered container with 24px gutter. The page is built as a vertical stack of distinct sections separated by 80px gaps, with a thin #e5e7eb hairline divider between some sections. The hero opens full-bleed white with a centered headline stack (eyebrow → serif display → paragraph → CTA pair) and product screenshot cards floating below as a 3-column grid with slight stagger. The social-proof strip is a single horizontal row of customer wordmarks, centered, with a 5-star rating above. Product suite sections use a left-aligned text column beside a right-side visual column, alternating sides. A 2-column feature section uses a diagram on one side and a 2×3 icon+text grid on the other. Navigation is a single fixed top bar: logo left, product/customer/docs/pricing/resources center-left, sign-in and Book demo button right — the demo button is the only filled violet element in the chrome. No sidebar, no mega-menu, no sticky scroll behavior beyond the nav.

## Similar Brands

- **Linear** — Same near-monochrome light canvas with a single vivid accent and editorial restraint; both use hairline borders and compact density to feel precise rather than decorative
- **Stripe** — Similar quiet light-mode product chrome with one chromatic brand color used surgically; both use layered subtle shadows and pill buttons for primary actions
- **Mercury** — Same financial-product confidence expressed through generous whitespace, editorial sans typography, and violet/purple accent appearing only on primary actions
- **Vercel** — Both use a near-white canvas with hairline #e5e7eb borders as the dominant structural element, and rely on a single brand color rather than multi-color palettes
- **Notion** — Same light-dominant interface with muted gray text hierarchy and pill-shaped interactive controls; both treat color as functional punctuation rather than decoration
